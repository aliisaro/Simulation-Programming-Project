(a) Why does an arrival event need to generate a new arrival event?

Answer: In a simulaton the system is often made to anticipates a new event after the last one.
The rate of the arrival event can be made constant (meaning new event starts immediately after the last one),
or the arrival rate can be made random to add unpredictability. Unpredictability
makes the simulation more realistic.


b) Which event should be generated by the start of the service?
Immediately after an arrival event, you would typically generate a
service event to signify the start of servicing the entity that just arrived.
